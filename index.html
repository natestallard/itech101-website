      <h2>Industry overview</h2>
      <p>
        The healthcare industry encompasses hospitals, clinics, medical-device companies, and digital-health services that together deliver patient care and medical innovation. It combines clinical expertise, regulated products, and increasingly, data-driven technology to diagnose, treat, and monitor patients.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Career of interest: Clinical Data Analyst</h2>
      <p>
        A Clinical Data Analyst works at the intersection of medicine and information: collecting, cleaning, and analyzing patient and device data to help clinicians make evidence-based decisions and to support quality-improvement initiatives. This role requires technical skills (SQL, statistics), domain knowledge, and careful attention to privacy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ethical issue that could arise</h2>
      <p>
        One prominent ethical issue is balancing patient privacy against the benefits of data sharing. Analysts may discover that releasing or aggregating datasets can accelerate research but could also risk re-identification of patients or expose sensitive information if controls are weak.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How my personal values shape my response</h2>
      <p>
        I value patient autonomy and respect for persons. That leads me to prioritize strong de-identification, informed-consent practices, and minimizing data access to only those who need it. When trade-offs appear, I advocate for the least-harmful approach that preserves patients' dignity while enabling beneficial research.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cybersecurity issues in this career/industry</h2>
      <p>
        Healthcare is frequently targeted by ransomware, phishing, and supply-chain attacks. Clinical Data Analysts and their teams must be aware that improper access controls, insecure data pipelines, and unpatched medical devices can lead to breaches that harm patients and interrupt care.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ransomware locking electronic health records</li>
        <li>Phishing that captures provider credentials</li>
        <li>Insecure APIs exposing patient data</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cybersecurity best practices for healthcare</h2>
      <p>
        Best practices include strong authentication (multi-factor), role-based access control, end-to-end encryption of data in transit and at rest, regular vulnerability scanning and patching, secure development practices for apps and APIs, and continuous staff training to reduce phishing risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        For data analysts specifically: use anonymization techniques, maintain audit logs, limit exports, and coordinate with the security team before sharing datasets externally.
